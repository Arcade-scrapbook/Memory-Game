### Memory Game

I know youâ€™ve probably seen many memory games before, but this one is different! Instead of matching random items, this game tests your memory with logos of coding languages. I hope you enjoy it!

The idea for this game came from a website, where it was presented as text. I used that as inspiration and coded it myself. 

AI was used minimally in this project, primarily for small optimizations.
